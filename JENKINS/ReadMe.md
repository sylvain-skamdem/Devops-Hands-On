# Jenkins Hands-on

This repository contains a hands-on project demonstrating the usage of Jenkins for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD). 

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/download/): Version X.X.X or higher.
- [Any other dependencies or tools required for your specific project.]

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

├── Jenkinsfile

├── scripts/

│ ├── build.sh

│ ├── deploy.sh

│ └── ...

├── src/

│ └── ...

└── README.md



- `Jenkinsfile`: This file contains the Jenkins pipeline script, defining the stages and steps of the CI/CD process.
- `scripts/`: A directory containing any custom scripts used in the project, such as build and deployment scripts.
- `src/`: This directory contains the source code of your application or project.

## Usage

git clone https://github.com/your-username/jenkins-hands-on.git
```


2. Set up a Jenkins server or use an existing Jenkins instance.

3. Create a new Jenkins job or pipeline project.

4. Configure the Jenkins job to use your project's repository as the source code repository.

5. In the Jenkins job configuration, specify the Jenkinsfile present in the repository as the pipeline script.

6. Run the Jenkins job to trigger the CI/CD process.

## Clean Up

To clean up the Jenkins job or pipeline, you can simply delete the job from your Jenkins instance.
