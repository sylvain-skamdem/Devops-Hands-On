# Docker Hands-on

This repository contains hands-on projects demonstrating the usage of Docker for containerization and deployment.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/): Version X.X.X or higher.
- [Any other dependencies or tools required for your specific project.]

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

├── Dockerfile

├── docker-compose.yml

├── app

│ ├── index.js

│ ├── package.json

│ └── ...

└── README.md


- `Dockerfile`: This file contains the instructions to build a Docker image for your application.
- `docker-compose.yml`: Defines a multi-container application using Docker Compose, allowing for easy orchestration and configuration.
- `app/`: A directory containing your application code and any other necessary files.

## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/docker-hands-on.git
```

2. Change into the project directory:
```bash
cd docker-hands-on
```

3. Modify the `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` files as needed for your application.

4. Build the Docker image:
```arduino
docker build -t your-image-name .
```


5. Run the Docker container:

```arduino
docker run -p 8080:80 your-image-name
```

6. Access your application in a web browser at `http://localhost:8080`.

## Clean Up

To stop and remove the running Docker container, use the following command:
```arduino
docker stop <container-id-or-name>
```

Replace `<container-id-or-name>` with the actual ID or name of your container.
