Prerequisites
To install Docker Desktop successfully, you must:

Meet the system requirements
Have a 64-bit version of either Ubuntu Jammy Jellyfish 22.04 (LTS) or Ubuntu Impish Indri 21.10. Docker Desktop is supported on x86_64 (or amd64) architecture.
For non-Gnome Desktop environments, gnome-terminal must be installed:

>sudo apt install gnome-terminal
Uninstall the tech preview or beta version of Docker Desktop for Linux. Run:
>sudo apt remove docker-desktop

For a complete cleanup, remove configuration and data files at $HOME/.docker/desktop, the symlink at /usr/local/bin/com.docker.cli, and purge the remaining systemd service files.
>rm -r $HOME/.docker/desktop
>sudo rm /usr/local/bin/com.docker.cli
>sudo apt purge docker-desktop

Note
If you have installed the Docker Desktop for Linux tech preview or beta version, you need to remove all files that were generated by those packages (e.g., ~/.config/systemd/user/docker-desktop.service, ~/.local/share/systemd/user/docker-desktop.service).


Update the Repository
Ensure that the local system package repository is updated by running:
>sudo apt update


Install Docker
Run the following command to install Docker:
>sudo apt install docker.io -y
  
 
Install Dependencies
Install all the Docker dependency packages by running the following command:
>sudo snap install docker


Check Installation
Check whether Docker was properly installed by running the status command or checking the program version. To see the Docker daemon status, run:
>sudo systemctl status docker

Alternatively, check the program version by running:
>docker --version
