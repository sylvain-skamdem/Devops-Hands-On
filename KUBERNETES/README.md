# Kubernetes Hands-on

This repository contains a hands-on project demonstrating the usage of Kubernetes for container orchestration and management. 

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/): Version X.X.X or higher.
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/): The Kubernetes command-line tool.
- [Any other dependencies or tools required for your specific project.]

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

├── manifests/

│ ├── deployment.yaml

│ ├── service.yaml

│ └── ...

├── scripts/

│ ├── setup.sh

│ ├── teardown.sh

│ └── ...

└── README.md


- `manifests/`: This directory contains Kubernetes manifest files, such as deployment and service definitions.
- `scripts/`: A directory containing any custom scripts used in the project, such as setup and teardown scripts.

## Usage

To use this project with Kubernetes, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/kubernetes-hands-on.git
```

2. Set up a Kubernetes cluster or use an existing cluster.

3. Ensure that `kubectl` is properly configured to communicate with your Kubernetes cluster.

4. Modify the Kubernetes manifest files in the `manifests/` directory according to your application or project requirements.

5. Deploy the Kubernetes resources using `kubectl`:
```
kubectl apply -f manifests/
```

6. Access your deployed application or services using the appropriate service endpoints.

## Clean Up

To clean up the deployed Kubernetes resources, run the following command:
```
kubectl delete -f manifests/
```

This will remove the resources defined in the Kubernetes manifest files.
